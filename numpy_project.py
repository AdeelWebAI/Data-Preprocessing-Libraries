# Real-World Projects Using NumPy


# 1. Analyzing Student Scores

# Load student scores and compute statistics.

import numpy as np
# np.random.seed(42)
# scores = np.random.randint(50,100,(10,5)) # 10 students and 5 subjects
# print("scores: \n",scores) 

# print("mean score: ", np.mean(scores, axis=1))# means score of students at axis 1 (Y axis) 
# print("minumum score: ", np.min(scores, axis=1)) # minimum score of students 
# print("maximum score: ", np.max(scores, axis=1)) # maximum score of students
